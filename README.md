In data science using Python, I worked with Anaconda's Jupyter Notebook 📝. I used libraries like Pandas for handling data 🧹, NumPy for numerical operations 🔢, and Matplotlib for creating beautiful charts and graphs 📊.

For machine learning, I learned and implemented different algorithms 🤖 like:

Simple Linear Regression: Predicting continuous values based on one variable 📈.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifying data points based on how close they are to each other 👥.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Finding the best line or boundary that separates data into different groups 🧠.
These tools and algorithms helped me in manipulating and visualizing data as well as building smart models! 🚀
